# virtual-keyboard

FEATURES:

    This pride themed virtual keyboard opens when the user clicks on the text box located on the site. It has an animated zoomIn entrance and a delayed tada animation that makes the keys shake after the keyboard zooms into view. The special buttons include a space bar, an enter button, a backspace, a done button, and a capsLock button. The capsLock button has a light that turns on and off depending on rather the button is active. The done button closes the keyboard. Also included are the regular letters, numbers, and basic punctuation. The keys feature a hover and active state and are created and rendered using javascript to inject them into the html. 

    STYLING:

        The background of the keyboard is a color gradient meant to mimic the pride flag. The special icons are all from Font Awesome.
